# replPackageSystem
A online repository for packages for replit.com where it will be fetched by HTTP requests

## How it works
From replit, a user will send a HTTP request to the raw files of this repository. The code in the specific file will be wriiten in a file where it is imported. This means replit users (and others) can simply retrieve packages fast and effiecent.

## Current Packages
- PyTest
PyTest is like unit testing. It has three functions:

* testTrue
* testFalse
* test

testTrue(func):
This tests if the function returns True, the function must have a 'return'.

testFalse(func):
This tests if the function returns False, the function must have a 'return'.

test(func,value):
This tests if the function returns the value, the function must have a 'return'.
