# replPackageSystem
A online repository for packages for replit.com where it will be fetched by HTTP requests

## How it works
From replit, a user will send a HTTP request to the raw files of this repository. The code in the specific file will be wriiten in a file where it is imported. This means replit users (and others) can simply retrieve packages fast and effiecent.

## Current Packages
